## Quick start guide
### Install
Getting started with PolyFlow is simple. Just use pip install and the following command:
    
    `pip install polyflow`

This can be done in your own environment if desired. Soon a custom environment will be available. 

NOTE: the pip install for Bingo is not currently working and the source install will need
to be used instead. See the Bingo github: https://github.com/nasa/bingo
